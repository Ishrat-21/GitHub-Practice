<h1>
    Climate Change
</h1>

<p>
    Climate change includes both global warming driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases and the resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns. 
    Though there have been previous periods of climatic change, since the mid-20th century humans have had an unprecedented impact on Earth's climate system
     and caused change on a global scale. The largest driver of warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, of which more than 90% are carbon dioxide (CO
2) and methane. Fossil fuel burning (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy consumption is the main source of these emissions, with additional contributions 
from agriculture, deforestation, and manufacturing.[4] The human cause of climate change is not disputed by any scientific body of national or international 
standing. Temperature rise is accelerated or tempered by climate feedbacks, such as loss of sunlight-reflecting snow and ice cover, increased water vapour 
(a greenhouse gas itself), and changes to land and ocean carbon sinks.

    Covid 19 Pandemic
</h1>

<p>
    The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory 
    syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency 
    of International Concern on 20 January 2020, and later a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 1 April 2021, more than 129 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 2.82 
    million deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history. Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to life-threatening 
    illness. The virus spreads mainly through the air when people are near each other.[b] It leaves an infected person as they breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak and enters another 
    person via their mouth, nose, or eyes. It may also spread via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to two weeks, and can spread the virus even if they are
     asymptomatic.
